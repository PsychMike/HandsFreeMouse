<listitem><para>Included documentation creation for the Windows platform and combined the old methods into one (small effective differences)</para></listitem><listitem><para>No longer storing the doxygen binary file in the prefs as a lot of tools must be present on the path anyways. The new paradigm is to expect all required 3rd-party programmes to be available on PATH. As backup the configuration files directory is added to the Matlab PATH environment <bold>nonpermanently</bold> and any executables found there will thus also be usable.</para></listitem><listitem><para>Included checks for <computeroutput>dot</computeroutput> and <computeroutput>latex</computeroutput> at the setup stage to recommend installation of those tools if not present (the default doxygen settings in Doxyfile.m4 are to use both)</para></listitem></itemizedlist>
</para><para>(dw, 2011-11-08) Improved the createUnix method by displaying the warnings and writing the output to a log file afterwards. Not using cprintf anymore as this is 3rd party software.</para><para>(dw, 2011-11-07) Fixed a recursion bug caused by copy and paste. Now the preferences are stored on an per-application basis.</para><para>(dw, 2011-11-04) Changed the name to <ref refid="class_matlab_doc_maker" kindref="compound">MatlabDocMaker</ref> in order to export it into the mtoc++ distribution later.</para></listitem>
